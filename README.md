#### On Mac\Linux



### What does this code do?
- This sample will show you how to create a test key and secret in Key Vault
- It will also show you how to retrieve the secret from Key Vault

- Next if we need to point the users to different section of code (in a different file) we still have the code copy here and explain what it does
- This section should feel like a story where we explain 
  - What concepts we want users to understand?
  - What sections of code we want users to focus on?
  - As a result Best practices that we want users to follow
